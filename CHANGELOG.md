## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- TODO
[] Linux system testing

[] Configuration of min, max and error limits/thresholds and ability to pass in payload.
[] Possibly refactor code to split configuration parameters from code.  Because of how the PRTG sensor execution happens this may not be a fruitful activity, but it is on the radar.

### Added

- Support for both Python Script Advanced sensor (pull sensor) and HTTP Push Data Advanced sensor (puss sensor) in same code based
